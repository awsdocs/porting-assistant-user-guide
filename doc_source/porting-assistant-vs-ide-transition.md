# Transition from standalone tool to Porting Assistant for \.NET Visual Studio IDE extension<a name="porting-assistant-vs-ide-transition"></a>

**Note**  
If the Porting Assistant for \.NET Visual Studio IDE extension is not installed on Visual Studio, the transition process will include steps to download and install the extension\. 

From the **Assessed Solutions** page of the standalone assessment tool, choose **Open the solution in IDE**\. Visual Studio will open the solution and assessment that you performed using the standalone tool\. Once the IDE extension opens, you can port the solution with contextual assistance\. If your solution was at the assessment stage, all of the assessment details are shared with the IDE extension\. If you started the automated porting of the solution in the standalone tool, the IDE loads the current state of porting\.
